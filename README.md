# Engineering Frameworks Playbook  
**The practical, no-BS collection of frameworks that separate junior devs from senior engineers and architects in 2025+**



⭐ **Star this repo if you actually want to level up — not just collect tabs.**

This is the living, open-source companion to the blog series  
**“Beyond Coding: The Frameworks That Separate Junior, Mid, and Senior Engineers”**

Everything here is battle-tested in real companies (startups to BigTech) and kept brutally up-to-date.

## Why This Repo Exists

99 % of “framework” articles are either:
- Academic Wikipedia copies  
- 5-minute Medium listicles  
- Outdated since 2018

This repo (and the blog series) fixes that:
- Real copy-pasteable examples (Structurizr, Mermaid, Miro templates)  
- Clear “Junior / Mid / Senior” labeling  
- Updated every quarter for 2025–2026 realities  
- Zero corporate fluff

## Blog Series (read in order)

1. Architecture & Design Frameworks
2. Process & Development Frameworks (CI/CD, DevOps, trunk-based, etc.)  
3. Quality & Reliability (SRE, Clean Code, error budgets)  
4. Data Modeling (CQRS, Event Sourcing, graph vs relational)  
5. Communication & Documentation (C4, ADR, UML that doesn’t suck)  
6. The “Soft” Frameworks Only Seniors Need
